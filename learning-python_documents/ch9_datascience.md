# Data Science

### IPython & Jupyter notebook

* notebook : a web page that exposes a simple menu and the cells in which you can run Python code
* Pandas : Python Data Analysis Library



* Data science with Python
  * NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/): This is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number capabilities, and much more.
  * Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): This is probably the most popular machine learning library in Python. It has simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts. It's built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
  * Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/): This is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. We've used it throughout this whole chapter.
  * IPython (http://ipython.org/) / Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/): These provide a rich architecture for interactive computing.
  * Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/): This is a Python 2D plotting library that produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hard copy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell and notebook, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.
  * Numba (http://numba.pydata.org/): This gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance functions written directly in Python. With a few annotations, array oriented and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time compiled to native machine instructions, similar in performance to C, C++, and Fortran, without having to switch languages or Python interpreters.
  * Bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/): It's a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, but also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.



* Other than these single libraries, you can also find ecosystems such as SciPy (http://scipy.org/) and Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/), which bundle several different packages in order to give you something that just works in an "out-of-the-box" fashion.
